This is our final project in DATA130049 (Image Processing and Visualization).

## Usage
You can simply run the following code to use our model.

```shell
# simple ui provided by vtk
python model.py
```

```shell
# contains more functions
python gui.py
```

To run the demo in the menubar, you need to run MarchingCubes.py, MarchingTetra.py beforehand.
